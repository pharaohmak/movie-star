# Movie Collection Ranker

This project is a simple browser-based tool that ranks a user's movie collection based on the total number of movies. The tool is implemented in JavaScript and dynamically displays the user's rank on a webpage.

## Project Description

The Movie Collection Ranker allows users to input the number of DVDs, Blu-rays, and UltraViolets in their collection. Based on the total number of movies, the user is ranked as a Bronze, Silver, or Gold star member, and the corresponding rank is displayed on the webpage.
